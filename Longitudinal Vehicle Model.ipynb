    "Next I create an instance of the Vehicle model that accepts a constant throttle input. In the xy plot below, the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents the velocity of the vehicle. There are a few neat things to notice. First, the velocity converges to a fixed value because of aerodynamic drag and tire force limit. If you a(t) = dy/dx v(t), you would see that the acceleration will converge to 0 from the positive direction. A similar scenario can be seen when the incline angle $\\alpha$ < 0. When the vehicle is traveling down a hill, the gravity will accelerate the vehicle to a terminal velocity where it is balanced by the drag force."
