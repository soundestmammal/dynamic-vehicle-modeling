    "In this notebook, I will implement the kinematic bicycle model. The model accepts velocity and steering rate inputs and steps through the bicycle kinematic equations. Once the model is implemented, I will provide a set of inputs to drive the bicycle in a figure 8 trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bicycle kinematics are governed by the following set of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\dot{x}_c &= v \\cos{(\\theta + \\beta)} \\\\\n",
    "\\dot{y}_c &= v \\sin{(\\theta + \\beta)} \\\\\n",
    "\\dot{\\theta} &= \\frac{v \\cos{\\beta} \\tan{\\delta}}{L} \\\\\n",
    "\\dot{\\delta} &= \\omega \\\\\n",
    "\\beta &= \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{l_r \\tan{\\delta}}{L})\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs are the bicycle speed $v$ and steering angle rate $\\omega$. The input can also directly be the steering angle $\\delta$ rather that its rate in the simplified case. This Python model will allow for both implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will implement this model using a Python Class. I choose this design because it encapsulates the state variables as well as the functions for implementing the bicycle kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bicycle begins with zero initial conditions, has a maximum turning rate of 1.22 rad/s, a wheelbase length of 2m, and a length of 1.2m to its center of mass from the rear axle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now equipped with this information, I initialize the Python class as follows:"
